        <h2>Life </h2>
            <div class="textbox">
      <p> I was born in Castro Valley, but I have lived in East Oakland my whole life. I live with my mom, dad and younger brother. I have a grey kitten named Kogane.
      I am mexican-american, and my family comes from a small pueblo; Mixtlan, Jalisco. All of my family lives in Mexico, except my aunt and her small family.
          I travel to Mexico every year to visit them, and I get to see not only family but friends. </p> </div>

  <h2> Art </h2>
            <div class="textbox">
<p> Art is the hobby that has been with me for the longest time. For as long as I remember,
  I have always been drawn to the creative freedom that
    comes with being artistic and drawing one's creations. I love world bulilding, thinking about every aspect of a setting and visualizing it. I enjoy creating characters with unique.</p> </div>
              <br>
        <h2>  Other Hobbies </h2>
                <div class="textbox">
    <p> While art is one of my main passions, I do have other hobbies which I am very passionate about and continue to grow with everyday. I like doing volleyball,
      and I started playing when one of my friends told me my serves were good. I was in 8th grade, and the highschool team let us practice with them for the upcoming
      season the next year. I also am very into music, both listening and playing. I own a piano keyboard, and I love watching Youtube tutorials to learn songs since I
      can't read sheet music. Recently too, I got an Alesis electronic drum set. It's been my favorite thing to do ever since I got it, and while I currently can only play
      Twenty One Pilots song Stressed Out, I look foward to learning more. </p>
         <p>Listen to the song: <a class="bodylink" a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY"> Stressed Out (Youtube)</a></p>
